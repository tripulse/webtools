# webtools
A set of scripts that can be used in a browser to do such things that browsers doesn't provide by default. Such as â€” *dynamic gain while playing video in YouTube*, *annoying poupup ridoff in Quora*.

There's not so much here in this repository, the number of scripts are very less and most importantly this repo has less or even no reputation at all.

### Scripts
(*All*) most of the scripts are coded in *JavaScript* also known as ECMA-262 or ISO/IEC 16262. And, that's the scripting language supported by browsers. All the code is source code (no minification applied). 

Below is the structure tree of the repository. ([motivation](https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite))

- **multimedia**
  - `dynamicGain.js`
